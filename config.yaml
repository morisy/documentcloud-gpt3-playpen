title: GPT-3 Playground
description: >-
  Note that this plugin costs approximate one cent for every three documents analyzed, depending on the length and complexity of the prompt and documents. Give this a full prompt that you would pass into GPT-3 and it will run it against your selected documents, one at a time. Only looks at the first page of a document currently. If you define a custom model, [use the naming conventions from this section](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3). The prompt refers to the user input as the "Assignment," the document's text as "Document Text", and GPT-3's generated response as the "Answer," which can be helpful when defining your prompt.
