title: "GPT-3.5 Turbo Playground"
description: |
  Use GPT3.5 Turbo to help analyze your documents, right within DocumentCloud.

  Give this a full prompt that you would pass into GPT-3.5 Turbo and it will run it
  against your selected documents, one at a time. 

  The Add-On looks at the first 54,000 characters (~30 pages) in each document, if available. 
  Of course, if the document is only 1 page, it will only look at that page.
  
  The Add-On cost is approximately 1 AI credit per page if your document has around 1750 characters per page. 
  If your document has much more text per page, it may be more costly. Additionally, it may not be 30 pages.
  
  There is a dry-run option that tells you the cost of running the Add-On on your entire set without charging you. 
  The cost is capped at 30 AI credits per document per run. 

  If you have large documents but only care about the first 1000 characters in the document, you can set a limiter
  so that it costs less to run the Add-On. You can set the limit between 1,000 - 54,000 characters.
